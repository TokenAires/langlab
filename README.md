# Ethereum Language Lab

This repository contains an MPS project for experimenting with languages for Ethereum.

## Prerequisites

* MPS 2017.2 downloadable from http://jetbrains.com/mps
* mbeddr.platform downloadable from https://build.mbeddr.com/viewLog.html?buildId=39397&tab=artifacts&buildTypeId=Mbeddr2_Mbeddr_Gradle_platform
* iets3.opensource downloadable from https://build.mbeddr.com/viewLog.html?buildId=39360&tab=artifacts&buildTypeId=Iets3_BuildOrgIets3core

For the last two, log into the build server as guest (there's a link on the login page). Then download the two ZIPs.
Unzip them, which gives you two more ZIPs. Unzip the one *not* called "...allScipts.zip". This leads to a whole bunch
of directories. Copy all of them into the MPS "plugins" folder. Restart MPS.
