This repository contains an MPS project for experimenting with languages for Ethereum.

## Prerequisites/Install

* Install MPS 2017.2 from http://jetbrains.com/mps
* Download mbeddr.platform from https://build.mbeddr.com/viewLog.html?buildId=39397&tab=artifacts&buildTypeId=Mbeddr2_Mbeddr_Gradle_platform
* Download iets3.opensource from https://build.mbeddr.com/viewLog.html?buildId=39360&tab=artifacts&buildTypeId=Iets3_BuildOrgIets3core

For the last two, log into the build server as guest (there's a link on the login page). Then download the two ZIPs.
Unzip them. This leads to two more ZIPs, each. Unzip the one *not* called "...allScipts....zip". This creates to a whole bunch
of directories. Copy all of them into the MPS "plugins" folder. Restart MPS.
